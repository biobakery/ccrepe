CCREPE (Compositionality Corrected by Renormalization and Permutation)
is a package for analysis of sparse compositional data, such as from
metagenomic sequencing.  It determines the significance of association
between features in a composition, using any similarity measure
(e.g. Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, etc.)  The package also provides
a novel similarity measure, the N-dimensional checkerboard score
(NC-score), particularly appropriate to compositions derived from
microbial community sequencing data.  This results in p-values and
false discovery rate q-values corrected for the effects of
compositionality.
